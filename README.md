# ThinkRouter
**ThinkRouter** is an intelligent routing layer for Large Language Models (LLMs) that optimizes every AI request for **cost, speed, and performance** without sacrificing quality.

Instead of locking you into one expensive model, ThinkRouter dynamically analyzes each prompt and sends it to the most suitable model in real time. Simple queries are handled by lightweight, affordable models, while complex reasoning tasks are routed to premium LLMs. The result? **Up to 70% cost savings** compared to single-model solutions.

**Key Advantages:**

* **Adaptive Model Selection** – Routes prompts based on complexity and performance needs.
* **Cost Efficiency** – Automatically reduces unnecessary high-end model usage.
* **Performance-to-Price Optimization** – Maximizes results per dollar spent.
* **Full Spectrum Access** – Works with both open-source and closed-source models.
* **Multi-Agent Ready** – Fully compatible with frameworks like CrewAI.

**Integration Made Simple**
ThinkRouter can be deployed as a drop-in API replacement, a Python package, or a fully customized enterprise solution. It supports real-time cost tracking, a visual savings dashboard, and an interactive playground for testing and benchmarking.

**Why ThinkRouter?**
Whether you’re a **startup scaling AI features**, an **enterprise with high query volumes**, or a **multi-agent system builder**, ThinkRouter ensures you’re always using the right model for the job. By combining advanced prompt analysis with intelligent routing logic, it delivers **smarter AI allocation** and significant operational savings.

**Smarter routing. Lower costs. Better results.**
